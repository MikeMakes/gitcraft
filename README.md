# gitcraft
A minecraft server helper that uses git to share the files with your friends. 

Whenever you launch the server (with the proper launcher you can find here) it checks for updates in the world; in the same way when you stop playing, it uploads the new progress made in minecraft to git.

Git is perfect for keeping track of your world when multiple players want to host it alternatively.

As the world files are huge (for git standard) they are stored using Git Large File Storage.
